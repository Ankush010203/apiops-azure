## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

## Support Policy  

This project operates as an open source initiative, meaning that it lacks official backing from the Microsoft APIM product team. However, it's worth noting that Microsoft Cloud Solution Architects oversee its maintenance. These architects maintain a connection with the product team, granting them early exposure to the APIM roadmap.




# Project Support

Thank you for your interest in our open source project! We're here to help you with any issues, questions, or contributions you might have.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any bugs, have feature requests, or need assistance, please check the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/issues) on GitHub. Before submitting a new issue or feature request, please search the existing issues to make sure your concern hasn't already been addressed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute code, documentation, or anything else, please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get started.

## Contacting the Maintainers

While we don't have official support from the Microsoft APIM product team, the maintainers are continously monitoring the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/issues) on GitHub and thus its the best way to get in touch with them.

## Early Access to Roadmap

As the Microsoft Cloud Solution Architects are in touch with the product team, they have early access to the APIM roadmap. This enables them to provide insights and guidance on the project's future development.

Please remember that this project operates on a best-effort basis, and response times may vary based on maintainers' availability. We appreciate your understanding and collaboration in making this open source project a success!

Thank you,
The Project Team
